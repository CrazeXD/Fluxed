# Fluxed
 A tool for computing flux for distributions through N-dimensional shapes.

 The primary cases of this tool are in computing flux through an irregular shape numerically by defining the shape as a matrix of 1s and 0s, with 1s representing borders to the shape, then filling the shape with an intensity distribution. Fluxed also has inverse modelling capabilities to find parameters for a distribution to match flux to another shape and distribution.

See tests/ for examples of how to utilize Fluxed.
